- dashboard
    - show when screen updated

- config file
    - done: use config file
    - done: cmds
    - todo: error
    - todo: docs
    - todo: file format validation?
    - todo: config input keys

- interconnect screen
    - screen 1 start , then start screen 2
    - screen 1 stop, stop screen 2
    - ~~screen 1 start, wait 5 sec to start screen 2~~ could just use `sleep 5 && ...` for that
    - ~~screen 1 start, wait port open to start screen 2~~ can use wait-on lib for such thing

- split screen? maybe too complicated
